# Google Calendar + Strava Dashboard

A dashboard for visualizing data from [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/calendar) and [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/)

## Idea
- Use Google Calendar API for fetching event data.
- Use Strava API for fetching sleep and walk data.
- Use React or pre-built Material UI dashboard to display visualization.

## Tools
- Python and React/JS
- Might want to use Flask
